This project requires SBT 0.13.1 or higher. To run:

1. Execute:

    sbt "run-main org.vertx.java.platform.impl.cli.Starter run src/main/scala/com/example/HelloWorldServer.scala"

2. Go to http://localhost:8080 and you should see `Hello Scala World!` message

In the current configuration, when the main is executed, the Scala class is compiled on the fly by the
mod-lang-scala extension, instantiated and run.

Alternatively, this project can be run against a pre-release mod-lang-scala version, in which case:
1. Change mod-lang-scala version in `build.sbt` and `src/main/resources/langs.properties` files
2. Clone http://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-scala repository
3. Execute: `./gradlew clean install` from the cloned repository
4. Run `sbt update` on this example project
5. Run

    sbt "run-main org.vertx.java.platform.impl.cli.Starter run src/main/scala/com/example/HelloWorldServer.scala"

6. Go to http://localhost:8080 and you should see `Hello Scala World!` message
